% a kind of circular buffer that is only useful for smc_channel to keep the
% last N events, it has a MinSize and a MaxSize to avoid calling sublist on
% every add call when the buffer is full, by default the buffer will grow to
% twice the MinSize before being cut to MinSize, the items are stored in
% reverse order to take advantage of cons and because it's the default access
% pattern (get the last N events).
% take into account that when the buffer has more than MinSize and you operate
% on it you may get more than MinSize items in response, we don't hide the
% elements after MinSize
